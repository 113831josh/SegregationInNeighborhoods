      <h3> Shredded Hearts</h3>   <body>In this animation, there are two leaders. The yellow and blue leaders are arguing, which leads to them agreeing to seperate the two
      groups. However, the yellow and blue civilians are distraught because they had friends on both sides, but these two yellow and blue in particular were in love, and they
      were seperated.</body></div>
