<h1>Segregation in Neighborhoods</h1>
<body>
<h3>How Division Wounds Us</h3>
<p1>Down below is a collection of animations our group made to interpret the different cause and effects of segregation! Four different animations, and each with a
  different purpose.</p1>
</body>
 <div class="flex-container">
    <div><img src="saige.gif" alt="animation1" width="250" height="300">
      <h3> Shredded Hearts</h3>   <body>In this animation, there are two leaders. The yellow and blue leaders are arguing, which leads to them agreeing to seperate the two
      groups. However, the yellow and blue civilians are distraught because they had friends on both sides, but these two yellow and blue in particular were in love, and they
      were seperated.</body></div>
  <div><img src="saige2.gif" alt="animation2" width="250" height="300">
    <h3> Racism in Workplace </h3>   <body>In this animation, there are two different people recieving payment. However, yellow is being paid less than blue, and its because
    of his/her color. Blue is being paid more because of the benefit of his color.</body></div>
  <div><img src="bella1.gif" alt="animation3" width="250" height="300">
    <h3> Disparities in Health</h3> <body>  Due to a separation between neighborhoods, Blue circles are provided an easy avenue for bettering their health while the 
    Yellow triangles aren't given as much access to healthcare.</body> </div>
   <div><img src="praneeth1.gif" alt="animation4" width="250" height="300">
     <h3> Unity and Diversity </h3> <body> When a neighborhood is unified and diverse, people ae safe and happy within their community. Though if segregation is enforced in the 
     community, crime rates within the segregated neighborhoods increase. </body></div>

    

<h1> Segregation doesn't benefit people at all. The division of groups leads to detrimental effects like health disparities, wealth disparities, and increases in 
  crime rate. Not only does segregation hurt the marginalized group, it prevents interaction between both groups. With a lack of understanding between both groups,
  this leads to hostility and conflict. Assumptions are made, and misunderstandings start to form. People will benefit from actively erasing assumptions and reduce 
  bias and taking steps towards a more diverse community opens up more opportunities for both sides.</h1>
